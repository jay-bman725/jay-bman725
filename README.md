# 👋 Hey, I’m Jay (aka JayMakesVideos)

I'm a teenage developer, tech enthusiast, and YouTube content creator who breaks and builds stuff just for fun. I love tinkering with systems, making tools people actually want to use, and finding clever workarounds where others see roadblocks.

## 🧠 What I Do

* 🧑‍💻 Build apps, bots, and experiments — often open source
* 🐧 Tinker with Linux, proxies, and bypassing restrictions (ethically, of course 😉)
* 💡 Dream big, fail fast, and document the chaos

## 🔧 Projects I’m Proud Of

Even if some of these are still in progress, they mean a lot to me:

* **Custom Discord Bot** — Full moderation suite with OpenAI filtering, logging, leveling, and SQLite support
* **My Proxy Tool** — Built for schools that *really* want to lock you out... too bad
* **ChromeOS Fix Speedruns** — Not a repo, but my ability to fix school Chromebooks faster than IT is 100% real
* **Exploring Obscure OSes** — Testing, reviewing, and sometimes breaking niche systems
* **AutoCaption** - Making generating captions easier [here](https://github.com/jay-bman725/AutoCaption)
